# pacman_ppo
A self-study of reinforcement meaning, final application to Pacman on Atari.

This repository represents my self-study on reinforcement learning. A topic only briefly touched by my study programs.
I write the Reinforce, A2C and PPO algorithms from scratch and apply them to the lunar-lander-v2 gymnasium environment.
The final product is my PPO algorithm applied to the Pacman Atari environment. The performance is compared to the baseline PPO implementation [source].
This repository then also is a snapshot on how I study new topics, which is a continuous cycle of reading tutorials, literature analysis and writing my own implementations from scratch. 
All this while keeping track of useful links and notes in my personal notes file.

Please note that this is a hobby project, the code is messy. Not much refactoring is done. We want to get a proof of concept asap.
